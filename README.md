# Monster Hunter Now Events Calendar

This is a calendar subscription file for events that [Monster Hunter Now](https://monsterhunternow.com/) is running.

The events still need to be manually added (albeit in an easier manner) to the [events.txt](./events.txt) document, but when this file is modified it will automatically update the ICS file for anyone subscribed.

I created this because ultimately I'm lazy and wanted to subscribe to a feed instead of adding the events manually to my phone's calendar.
